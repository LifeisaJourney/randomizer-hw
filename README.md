# React state homework

Okay! You're job is to create a single component React application that randomizes a list of students into paired groups. Something that will come in handy in the future when we pair program!

For now, you're application should have a static list of Peloton students that are randomly put into pairs every time you press a button. You should __not__ have a text input to accept a list of students â€“ just a button to randomize and the pairs that are created.

This is a freeform homework without a mockup to work off of, so get creative with the design on your own! We may use your randomizer in class in the future, so make something that's ðŸ¤©sharp to look at! ðŸ‘€

There's boilerplate in `index.html` to get started with. Have fun!
